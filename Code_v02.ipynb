    "\n",
    "__Description:__\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Trips (starting point)\n",
    "1. Generating daily trips baseline for each city by multiplying its number of bikes by its bike \"friendliness\" score.\n",
    "2. Increasing daily trips based on season (+0% for Winter, +30% for Spring, +50% for Summer, +20% for Autumn)\n",
    "3. Increasing daily trips during weekends by 30%.\n",
    "4. Increasing daily trips during national holidays by 20%.\n",
    "5. Decrease daily trips by 85% during first covid lockdown (from March 17 to May 13).\n",
    "6. Adding noise and linear growth trend.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Users\n",
    "- `users`: Number of daily users. Obtained with daily trips divided by number between 1.1 and 6 centered around 3. Assumption that on average, the users will perform around 3 trips per day .\n",
    "- `subscribers`: Number of daily subcriber users. Obtained by generating `subscriber_ratio`, which gives the percentage of subscriber users out of all users. This ratio is around 75% during weekdays, and around 60% during weekends, based on the assumption that subscribers are more likely to use the bikes for communiting.\n",
    "- `occasional_users`: Number of daily non subscriber users. Total subscribers minus subscribers.\n",
    "- `new_subscribers`: Daily growth in subscribers equal to 1% of daily occasional users, assumption that unsubscriptions are accounted for.\n",
    "- `total_subscribers`: Running total of new subscribers. Initial number set at triple of first day's user count.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bikes\n",
    "- `bikes_in_maintenance`: Number of bikes in maintenance for the day, equal to number of trips per bike.\n",
    "- `bikes_available`: Number of available bike for the day, equal to total bikes allocated to city minus bikes in maintenance.\n",
    "- `bike_maintenance_cost`: Daily total bike maintenance cost (in €), obtained by multiplying number of bikes in maintenance with a random number between 30 and 100. Assumption that most repair costs per bike will fall in that range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Stations\n",
    "- `stations`: Number of stations per city, obtained by calculating 2.5 docks per bikes and assuming 15 docks per station. Assumption that the number of stations per city stays constant.\n",
    "- `station_maintenance_cost`: Daily station maintenance cost (in €), obtained by generating an array of 0 and 1, where the probability of having a 1 is lower but increases with more stations. This array is multiplyied by a random number between 300 and 1000, with the assumption that station repair costs fall into this range. The idea is that station repairs are not done every day, but only after accidents or vandalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Trips metrics\n",
    "- `trips_per_user`: Daily trips per user, obtained by dividing daily trips by number of daily users.\n",
    "- `trips_per_bike`: Daily trips per bike, obtained by dividing daily trips by number of bikes available.\n",
    "- `trips_per_1k_residents`: Daily trips per 1,000 residents, based on the city's population.\n",
    "- `avg_trip_duration`: Average daily trip duration (in min), random number taken from a distribution centered around 15.\n",
    "- `avg_trip_distance`: Average daily trip distance (in km), based on average speed in km/h obtained from a random distribution between 12 to 16, centered on 14.\n",
    "- `saved_CO2`: Approximate amount of daily saved CO2 emmission in kg, based on the assumption that each km saves 66g of CO2 (https://www.zoov.eu/en/blog/bike-life/sustainability-report-measuring-our-environmental-impact).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Business metrics\n",
    "- `daily_subcriber_revenue`: Daily revenue from subscribers (in €), based on a yearly subscription fee of 120€. Assumption that subscription allows for unlimited bike use.\n",
    "- `daily_occasional_users_revenue`: Daily revenue from occasional users (in €), based on a 1€ unlocking fee plus 15 cents per ride minute.\n",
    "- `daily_revenue`: Combined daily revenue from subscribers and occasional users (in €).\n",
    "- `daily_operational_expenses`: Daily operational expenses (in €), obtained by adding bike maintenance costs and station maintenance costs.\n",
    "- `daily_operating_income`: Daily operating income (in €), obtained by substracting daily operational expenses to daily income."
